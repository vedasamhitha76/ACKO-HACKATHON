    The "brain" of the AI assistant. This version is a high-speed, rule-based
    engine that generates reflexive questions based on the ACKO consultation script.
    It uses a comprehensive dictionary to map patient-mentioned keywords to the
    exact follow-up questions required by the underwriting process.
    This implementation has NO external AI/LLM dependencies, making it
    extremely fast and reliable.
